            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC, better known as Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-Indian 
                Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. 
                She was born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in Skopje, part of the Ottoman 
                Empire at the time. At the age of 18, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived 
                most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised as Saint Teresa of Calcutta.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Mother Teresa's given name was Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu Anjezë 
                            is a cognate of "Agnes"; Gonxhe means "rosebud" or "little flower" 
                            in Albanian. She was born on 26 August 1910 into a Kosovar Albanian 
                            family in Skopje, Ottoman Empire. She was baptised in Skopje 
                            the day after her birth. She later considered 27 August, the 
                            day she was baptised, her "true birthday"</p></div>

                        <h4>A call of the conscience </h4>
                        <p>In 1946, during a visit to Darjeeling by train, Mother Teresa felt that she heard the 
                            call of her inner conscience to serve the poor of India for Jesus. She asked for and 
                            received permission to leave the school. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, 
                            choosing a white sari with two blue borders as the order's habit.</p></div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Missionaries of Charity</h4>
                        <p>On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when 
                            she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. 
                            "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. 
                            To fail would have been to break the faith." Joseph Langford later wrote, 
                            "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become Mother Teresa".</p></div>

                                            replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, 
                                            white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa 
                                            adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in

                                            Family Hospital and ventured into the slums.
                                            She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before 
                                            she began tending to the poor and hungry. At the 
                                            beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her 
                                            effort by a group of young women, and she laid the 
                                            foundation for a new religious community helping 
                                            the "poorest among the poor".</p>

                                            the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their

                                            the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction.
                                            "A beautiful death", Mother Teresa said, "is for people who 
                                            lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted."

                                        <p class="description">The congregation began to attract recruits and donations, 
                                            and by the 1960s it had opened hospices, orphanages and 
                                            leper houses throughout India. Mother Teresa then expanded 
                                            the congregation abroad, opening a house in Venezuela in 
                                            1965 with five sisters. Houses followed in Italy (Rome),
                                            Tanzania and Austria in 1968, and, during the 1970s, the 
                                            congregation opened houses and foundations in the United 
                                            States and dozens of countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. </p>
